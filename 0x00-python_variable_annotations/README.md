## Introduction:
This project, 0x00-python_variable_annotations, is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum. It focuses on Python's type hints and variable annotations, which are essential tools for writing more readable and maintainable code, especially in larger projects.

Type annotations were introduced in Python 3.5 as part of PEP 484. They allow developers to explicitly state the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. While Python remains dynamically typed, these annotations can be used by static type checkers, IDEs, and other tools to catch potential bugs early, improve code readability, and provide better code completion and documentation.

This project aims to introduce the basics of type annotations and how they can be applied to Python variables and functions.

## Introduction:
This project is focused on understanding and implementing asynchronous comprehensions in Python. Asynchronous comprehensions allow for efficient and non-blocking iteration over asynchronous generators, which is particularly useful in I/O-bound tasks.

### Resources:
* [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/hlwtED-iLsdORSgly8DsyQ)
* [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/0OkbObYzCKtO7ZUAxfKvkw)
* [Type-hints for generators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/l4Fnno568VbVIn9GvrFVtQ)

### Learning Objectives

* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators
